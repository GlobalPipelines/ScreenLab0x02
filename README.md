=============

A pair of installations from my late 2012 residency at the University of Salford.

Portals allows for the mapping of horiztonal beams onto a body in real time - face, chest and crotch. The project uses a Kinect as gestural input.

Gateway allows for the gestural control of vertical beams of light via the Kinect.
